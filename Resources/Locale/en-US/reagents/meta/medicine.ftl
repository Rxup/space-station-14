reagent-name-epinephrine = epinephrine
reagent-desc-epinephrine = Effective at bringing people back from a critical state. Reduces some stun times. Easy to overdose on.

reagent-name-hyronalin = hyronalin
reagent-desc-hyronalin = A weak treatment for radiation damage. Considered to be useful mainly for genetic modification, where it reduces radiation levels, and thus the chance of genetic mutations. Largely outclassed by Arithrazine.

reagent-name-ipecac = ipecac
reagent-desc-ipecac = Induces vomiting. Useful for stopping a poisoning that isn't done metabolizing.

reagent-name-inaprovaline = inaprovaline
reagent-desc-inaprovaline = Inaprovaline is a synaptic stimulant and cardiostimulant. Commonly used to stabilize patients- it stops oxygen loss when the patient is in critical health. It'll also slow down bleeding by a good amount. Acts as a decent painkiller.

reagent-name-kelotane = kelotane
reagent-desc-kelotane = Treats burn damage. Overdosing greatly reduces the body's ability to retain water.

reagent-name-leporazine = leporazine
reagent-desc-leporazine = This keeps a patient's body temperature stable. High doses can allow short periods of unprotected EVA, but prevents use of the cryogenics tubes.

reagent-name-barozine = barozine
reagent-desc-barozine = A potent drug that prevents pressure damage. Causes extreme pain and jittering. Very poisonous when overdosed.

reagent-name-phalanximine = phalanximine
reagent-desc-phalanximine = Used in the treatment of cancer. Causes moderate radiation poisoning.

reagent-name-ambuzol = ambuzol
reagent-desc-ambuzol = A highly engineered substance able to halt the progression of a zombie infection.

reagent-name-ambuzol-plus = ambuzol plus
reagent-desc-ambuzol-plus = Further engineered with the blood of the infected, inoculates the living against the infection.

reagent-name-pulped-banana-peel = pulped banana peel
reagent-desc-pulped-banana-peel = Pulped banana peels have some effectiveness against bleeding.

reagent-name-siderlac = siderlac
reagent-desc-siderlac = A powerful anti-caustic medicine derived from plants.

reagent-name-spaceacillin = spaceacillin
reagent-desc-spaceacillin = A theta-lactam antibiotic. A common and very useful medicine, effective against many diseases likely to be encountered in space. Slows progression of diseases.

reagent-name-stellibinin = stellibinin
reagent-desc-stellibinin = A natual antitoxin with particular effectiveness against amatoxin.

reagent-name-synaptizine = synaptizine
reagent-desc-synaptizine = Toxic, but treats hallucinations, drowsiness & halves the duration of paralysis, stuns and knockdowns. One unit is enough to treat hallucinations; two units is deadly.

reagent-name-tranexamic-acid = tranexamic acid
reagent-desc-tranexamic-acid = A blood clotting medicine for preventing heavy bleeding. Very dangerous in large quantities.

reagent-name-tricordrazine = tricordrazine
reagent-desc-tricordrazine = A wide-spectrum stimulant, originally derived from Cordrazine. It's capable of healing most common damage types simultaneously, however only at about half the rate of other medications. Because of its low potency, it's best used as a supplement to other medicines.

reagent-name-lipozine = lipozine
reagent-desc-lipozine = Causes weight loss upon consumption.

reagent-name-omnizine = omnizine
reagent-desc-omnizine = A soothing milky liquid with an iridescent gleam. A well known conspiracy theory says that it's origins remain a mystery because knowing the secrets of its production would render most commercial pharmaceuticals obsolete.

reagent-name-ultravasculine = ultravasculine
reagent-desc-ultravasculine = Rapidly flushes toxins from the body, but places some stress on the veins. Do not overdose.

reagent-name-oculine = oculine
reagent-desc-oculine = Heals eye damage.
