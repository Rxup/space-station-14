ent-MachineAnomalyVessel = anomaly vessel
    .desc = A container able to harness a scan of an anomaly and turn it into research data.
ent-MachineAnomalyVesselExperimental = experimental anomaly vessel
    .desc = An advanced anomaly vessel capable of greater research potential at the cost of increased volatility and low-level radioactive decay into the environment.
ent-MachineAPE = A.P.E.
    .desc = An Anomalous Particle Emitter, capable of shooting out unstable particles which can interface with anomalies.
ent-MachineAnomalyGenerator = anomaly generator
    .desc = The peak of pseudoscientific technology.
