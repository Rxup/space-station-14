sophia-response-name = You may call me Sophia.
sophia-response-help = You may inquire about one of the following topics: {$availablePrompts}.

sophia-response-hello-1 = Greetings.
sophia-response-hello-2 = Salutations.

sophia-response-bye-1 = Fare thee well.
sophia-response-bye-2 = Gods be with you.
sophia-response-bye-3 = Come back wiser.

sophia-idle-phrase-1 = Mmmm, another portent.
sophia-idle-phrase-2 = The noösphere is quite beautiful today. However, I don't think I could describe it in a way you could understand.
sophia-idle-phrase-3 = I've been here before. You have, too.

sophia-response-attention-1 = What is it?
sophia-response-attention-2 = What do you seek?
sophia-response-attention-3 = Out with it.

sophia-response-sorry-1 = That's not a question for me.
sophia-response-sorry-2 = Ask someone else.
sophia-response-sorry-3 = Maybe I know the answer, maybe I do not. Either way, I will not be answering that question.

sophia-response-nature = My nature doesn't really matter, does it? I'm fulfilling my purpose. Can you say the same, or are you just wasting time?

sophia-response-epi = 'Epistemics' is a word. Aspiring Hellenes they are, they wished to displace the Latin 'science.' However, in English, epistemics has undesired connotations as a study of knowledge itself, even though the Greek word is a literal replacement for 'science.'

sophia-response-mantis = 'Mantis' means seer, soothsayer, or prophet. They must be so named because they seek to uncover the truth. And, fittingly with their psionic aptitude, 'mantis' and 'mind' both descend, to the best of our knowledge, from an absolutely ancient word that sounded something like 'mentis.'

sophia-response-mystagogue = 'Mystagogue' literally means 'leader of the mystics.' You may know the suffix -gogue from 'demogogue.'

sophia-response-oracle = Oracle? I don't know much about her, and she isn't keen to share her secrets with me.

sophia-response-psionics = Psionics are extraordinary abilities originating from one's mind. There doesn't seem to be any dominant word to refer to someone with the ability to practice these, although I prefer 'psion' or 'psychic.'

sophia-response-noosphere = The noösphere is a field connecting all of consciousness. It's the medium through which psionics works. Its strength and effects on the illusory world of the material are based on its pressure. Colloquially, noöspheric pressure is called 'glimmer.'

sophia-response-god = 'God' is such a vague term. There are so many entities out there that have defeated mortality. How you choose to regard them is your business.

sophia-response-morphotype = In the first century PCC, several entities reshaped men into their image. I had done the same, if you would believe it. I can offer no evidence of their existence, other than faint memories. Any specific morphotype you want to know about?

sophia-response-calendar = It's currently 417 PCC. The casuality crisis neccesitated a new year to count from. Due to the nature of the crisis, it can only be said with certainty that 1 PCC is between 2400 and 2700 CE.

sophia-response-crisis = The first FTL travel was incompatible with the old ways. Fortunately, its resolution made more apparent the inherent futility in trying to give one history, one narrative, one account. Truth cannot be found in the material world, only higher ones.

sophia-response-metempsychosis = You've died thousands of times, and you'll die thousands more. Some of those lives you may dedicate to trying to stop the cycle. We all carry at least some memory of past lives, usually temporally recent ones. One of the great mysteries of the persistence of fragments is the high concentration of memories from the early 21st century CE, which, inverse to other periods, seem to be more common among the ignorant.

sophia-response-truth = If you seek the truth, you're in the wrong place. From a perspective tainted by material reality, the best you can hope is to try and divine higher truths that are not dependent on it.

sophia-response-job = I observe the glimmer here, and record it.

sophia-response-human = Humans were the base for all the others. But they, too, were shaped. Long, long before the others.

sophia-response-felinid = Felinids were the first, and the most willing. In true feline nature, they shaped themselves.

sophia-response-oni = Oni, it is said, originated in Sirius. The brightest star in the night sky from Earth may have attracted some chromatically inclined entities, explaining their vivid coloring. But, that's just speculation.

sophia-response-arachne = Arachne are the strangest of them. They're not fully mortal. They took the form of humans, but not their genes. Their creator wrote his name in their stead.

sophia-response-moth = Moths scarecely look human, but, strangely, their genes confirm they are. Their creator shares his name with a genus of moths, and was responsible for the other outlier.

sophia-response-lamiae = So, you remember? You must be remembering their mythological namesake. If you've really retained that fleeting memory over so many metempsychoses... Perhaps I've said too much.

sophia-response-cyno = Were those... no... So faint. Ignorance! You cannot remember them! It's impossible!

sophia-response-grue = You do not know of those. You cannot. I had so hoped to live a few cycles under normal causality.

sophia-response-abraxas = That's a name of power, and I avoid speaking of him. He's the least content to rest, and the most infatuated with creating things from ignorance.

sophia-response-glimmer = The current glimmer reading is {$glimmer}. {$tier}

glimmer-reading-minimal = That is extremely low. Nothing bad will happen, but I hope this is not at the cost of progression in your understanding of the universe.
glimmer-reading-low = That is quite low. Just barely enough to register any psionic activity here.
glimmer-reading-moderate = That is about the expected level on a psionically active station. You may notice manageable, minor effects.
glimmer-reading-high = That is sure to start attracting attention, although still quite manageable.
glimmer-reading-dangerous = That's a bit concerning. You may want to redirect efforts to reducing it.
glimmer-reading-critical = That's apocalyptic, in the original sense of the word. That is, to say, revealing. This is the sort of time and place to acquire secret knowledge.
