  [color=#ffa500]Внимание! Эта раса имеет сильно ограничивающие игровые механики и не рекомендуется для новых игроков. [/color]

  Vox always spawn wearing working nitrogen internals equipment.
  A spare breathing mask and an emergency nitrogen canister is provided in their survival box.

  In addition to regular foods, Vox can also eat various snack packaging, banana peels, eggshells, and raw meat without any ill effects. They also like to drink welding fuel.

  Vox [color=#1e90ff]slowly recover from low levels of poison damage[/color] on their own,
  so long as they are careful not to exceed 20 poison damage.
  This allows them to endure breathing station air for up to thirty seconds at a time without lasting damage,
  letting them quickly eat, drink, take oral medication, and so on.
  A thirty second oxygen exposure takes them two minutes to recover from.
  If their health does not seem to improve within a minute of oxygen exposure, they should seek medical attention.

  Vox deal Slash damage with their unarmed attack.
