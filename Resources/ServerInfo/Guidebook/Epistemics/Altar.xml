# Altars and Golemancy
## Altars
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarNanotrasen" />
The chapel has a [color=#a4885c]sacrificial altar[/color]. To use it, a psionic humanoid must be placed on it, and someone with either psionics or clerical training must initiate the sacrifice.
It appears in the context menu on the altar, which can be opened with the right mouse button by default.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CrystalSoul" />
Once sacrificed, the psionic humanoid's soul is trapped inside a [color=#a4885c]soul crystal[/color]. This is not the end for them; they can still talk both vocally and telepathically, and this form is much harder to destroy.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PonderingOrbTelepathic" />
10% of the time, the altar will spawn a powerful psionic item along with the soul crystal. This chance increases to 50% if the sacrifice was performed by someone with clerical training, such as the [color=#a4885c]chaplain[/color] or [color=#a4885c]mystagogue[/color].

## Golemancy
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobGolemCult"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobGolemWood"/>
</Box>
Soul crystals can be installed into [color=#a4885c]golems[/color] to give the soul a new body. Golems are bound to serve their master. As constructs, they do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
Note that for wood golems, if plants are planted on top of their head, the plants will still need those things.
