- author: PJB3005
  changes:
  - message: Fixed pressure damage calculations to what they were always supposed
      to be. This means pressure damage now starts happening at more extreme values
      (20 kPa for low pressure damage instead of 50 kPa) and high pressure damage
      is scaled different. It also fixed the HUD alerts so that the "warning" alerts
      show up before you actually start taking damage.
    type: Fix
  - message: Air alarms now start complaining about low pressure much earlier, when
      the pressure drops so much that you can't breathe oxygen tank.
